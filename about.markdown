# Bio
Over the past ten-plus years, I have had the privilege to work with various industries, technologies, and languages including, but not limited to Microsoft Bot Framework, Machine Learning and Cognitive Services, Azure, .NET, SharePoint, M365, Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Power Platform, Nintex, MSFT SQL Server, PHP, JavaScript, JAVA and the AWS platform. I have worn the hats of the developer, architect, team lead, and software engineer with a mission of equity.

Bit of an outdoors guy here and love to hike.
